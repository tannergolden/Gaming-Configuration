								DISCLAIMER
	 Although no punishment should take effect on your account, I am not responsible for your misfortune while using the files.

### Information
My **_Gaming Configuration_** repository contains all my Video Game configuration files. If you want to use or test my personal settings feel free to. However, before using the configs I created you must read & agree to the [License](https://github.com/Plexol/Gaming/blob/master/LICENSE) agreement. All Configuration files contain all settings from `Video` `Gameplay` `Controls` `Audio` and `Multiplayer` for the specific game selected.

Click on the **Branch** options and select the game title you wish to view configurations for. Then, click the **[Clone or Download]** button to download the game you selected. All game folders come with files called `READ ME` `LICENSE` `INSTALL`, just read all of them to setup the package correctly.
